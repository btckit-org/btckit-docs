In practice, there are two standards:

- [**Methods & Events**](/docs/01-standard/01-methods-events/README.md): JSON RPC 2.0 compatible methods and events with their respective parameters and return types.
- [**Interface**](/docs/01-standard/02-interface/README.md): A global JavaScript object provides a simple interface for communicating with the wallet.

## Notes

_This is a work in progress, and is subject to change._

This document outlines a simple, easy to use, and secure Bitcoin wallet standard — inspired by, and built on top of, proven standards in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

:::note ⚠ draft
The standard is not yet finalized and will likely be renamed to something more appropriate. We are thinking about using this as the basis for a new BIP. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](https://github.com/btckit-org/btckit-docs/issues)!
:::

`todo: "kit" might imply that it's a library, so the standard will likely find a new home/name and btckit could become the go-to "implementation" of the standard.`
